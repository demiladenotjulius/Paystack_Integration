Node.js Server Starter Pack

This is a basic starter pack for building a Node.js backend server using Express and integrating with a database. It includes features for user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and password hashing using bcrypt.

Setup

Prerequisites
Node.js (version >= 12.0.0)
npm (or yarn)
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone (https://github.com/demiladenotjulius/server-starter/tree/main)
npm install
Configuration
Set up environment variables:Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:
PORT=3000
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
JWT_SECRET=yourjwtsecret
Modify the values accordingly. PORT is the port number on which the server will run, DB_CONNECTION_STRING is the connection string to your MongoDB database, and JWT_SECRET is the secret key used to sign JWT tokens.
Usage

Start the server:
npm start
The server will start on the specified port (default is 3000). You can now access the API endpoints described below.

API Endpoints

POST /api/auth/signup: Register a new user
POST /api/auth/login: User login and authentication, returns a JWT token
GET /api/users/profile: Get user profile (protected route, requires JWT token)
Folder Structure

models/: Contains database models (e.g., User model)
routes/: Defines API routes and controllers
middlewares/: Middleware functions (e.g., authentication middleware)
config/: Configuration files (e.g., database connection setup, JWT setup)
index.js: Main entry point of the application
Dependencies

express: Web framework for Node.js
mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool
bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords
jsonwebtoken: JSON Web Token implementation for Node.js
